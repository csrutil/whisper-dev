# WhisperOS

**WhisperOS** is a user-friendly operating system designed for small, portable radio devices (like Heltec LoRa boards) that allow you to communicate without the internet or cellular networks. It creates a "mesh" network where devices talk directly to each other.

Think of it like a walkie-talkie for text messages that can also hop through other people's devices to reach further.

## Key Features for You

### 1. **Off-Grid Messaging**
   - **Text Anyone**: Send and receive text messages to other users on the network.
   - **Privacy**: Your messages stay on the local mesh network, not on the internet.
   - **Contacts List**: See who else is nearby or on the network. It shows you when they were "last seen" (e.g., "5m ago"), so you know if they are available.
   - **Smart Typing**: Includes a **virtual keyboard on the device itself** with **predictive text** (English and Chinese input) to make typing easier on small screens.
   - **Multilingual Display**: Supports **CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean)** and many other languages for message display.

### 2. **Simple Dashboard**
   - **At a Glance**: Quickly check your unread messages, battery life, and connection status (Bluetooth).
   - **Uptime**: See how long your device has been running.

### 3. **Customize Your Experience**
   - **Notifications**: Choose how you want to be alerted—Beep (Buzzer), Flash (LED), or Vibrate. You can turn them all off for a "Do Not Disturb" mode.
   - **Display Settings**: Adjust brightness or set "Always On" watch faces (like a binary clock or cute animal faces) if you want your device to double as a desk clock.
   - **Night Mode**: Easily dim the screen or turn it off to save battery.

### 4. **Power Management**
   - **Battery Info**: Detailed battery voltage monitoring to help you manage power during long trips.
   - **Auto-Sleep**: The device is smart about saving power when you aren't using it.
   - **Long Lasting**: For Heltec V3 & V4, it could last **5 days**.

### 5. **Technical Tools**
   - **Radio Status**: A specialized screen shows you the signal strength (RSSI) of the last message, with a visual graph (sparkline) to help you find the best spot for reception.
   - **Connection Options**: Manage Bluetooth (to connect to your phone) and WiFi settings directly.

## Who is this for?
- **Hikers & Campers**: Communicate in areas with no cell service.
- **Emergency Preppers**: Reliable backup communication when towers are down.
- **Tech Enthusiasts**: Fun way to chat and experiment with radio tech.
- **Groups/Events**: Coordinate with friends at festivals or large events where networks are congested.

In essence, **WhisperOS** turns a simple radio board into a fully functional, standalone communicator that fits in your pocket.
